twitter_icon
------------
Adds the number of new tweets to the favicon of any open twitter.com tab. Note: Requires a remote PHP script for generation of the actual favicon.


4chan_webm
----------
Adds a link for inline expansion of WebM files for all post that contain one. Wraps the movie in a proper `<video>`-tag and enables clicking to pause/resume. This works similarly to the (now updated) native 4chan extension, but it seems a bit more reliable in Opera 12. 


neogaf_review
-------------
Adds a custom text-field under each user on the NeoGAF forums. Usefull for making up custom titles, keeping track of the worst shills or just other general user notes. All text gets stored using localStorage.
